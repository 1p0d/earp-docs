## Purchasing the resource

Find this product at:

Base: [https://store.ea-rp.com/package/5208515](https://store.ea-rp.com/package/5208515)

## Downloading the resource

Download this resource via [https://keymaster.fivem.net/asset-grants](https://keymaster.fivem.net/asset-grants) after purchasing it. It can take a few minutes for the resource to appear in keymaster after purchase.

## Installing the resource

1. Drag the resource into your resources folder.

1. Ensure or start this resource in your server.cfg. Example:
```lua
ensure night_garage_system
```

1. Configure /config/config.lua.

*Use the example below to understand the configuration of this resource!*

* Set the LocationVehicleShowcase coordinates and heading first, this will show the marker and/or label for the garages. This is also the point where the camera "looks" at.
* Set the LocationVehicleCamPos coordinates somewhere close to the LocationVehicleShowcase coordinates. LocationVehicleCamPos is the coordinate where the vehicle will be showcased only for the player in vehicle preview.
* Set the LocationVehicleSpawn coordinates where the vehicle should eventually spawn.

## Using [Discord API?](https://docs.ea-rp.com/resources/discordAPI/)

* Set up the Discord API by following the included documentation.pdf file in the resource.
* Match GarageRolePermissions & SectionRolePermissions role names (this config.lua) to the ones configured in config.lua (night_discordapi).
* List the vehicles according to the given format. Only the people with the role can SPAWN the vehicles. They can see it regardless of the permission. The reason for having 2 permission variables is because some vehicles can be listed in the same section, but some sections and it's vehicles are to be used by different roles. (Example: Police Officer & Sergeant)

## Want to add another garage or section?

* Compare Police Garage (GarageSections = ) to Ambulance garage (GarageSections). You can see police has 2 sections. Follow that format to add a section to a garage. 
* If you desire to add a whole garage somewhere. Use the same format, but in this case copy the whole garage code. You can look at how I added 3 garages as examples.

## Want to add vehicles?

* Simply add "yourvehicle", in the given format under SectionVehicles of the garage you want to add it to. Don't forget the comma!
